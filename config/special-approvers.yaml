# Special Approvers Configuration
# These users can override OPA failures with proper justification

special_approvers:
  - pragadeeswarpa
  # Add more special approvers here:
  # - admin-user
  # - security-team-lead
  # - devops-lead

# How special approval works:
# 1. PR must have OPA failure
# 2. Special approver must approve the PR
# 3. Special approver must comment with "OVERRIDE" keyword
# 4. Comment must include justification and risk assessment
#
# Example override comment:
# ```
# OVERRIDE: Emergency production fix required
# Risk: Low - temporary workaround for critical bug
# Timeline: Proper fix planned for Sprint 24
# Reviewed-by: Security team
# ```
